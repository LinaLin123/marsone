              <h2>Is this trip risky?</h2>
              <p>
                The trip to Mars cannot be called risk free. Like any venture in
                any means of travel, there are always things that could go
                wrong. In the case of Mars One, the following risks are
                conceivable:
              </p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Accident(s) during launch</li>
                <li>Vital components could malfunction</li>
                <li>There could be problems when landing</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Although traveling to Mars will evidently bring risks, if you
                were to compare our mission to the first Moon mission in 1969,
                it quickly becomes apparent that this mission is much safer.

                During the working hours, the astronauts will be busy performing
                three main tasks: construction, maintenance and research.
                Besides work, they will also have time to relax.

              <h2>Why on earth would anyone move to Mars?</h2>
              <p>
                The short answer is. Because we can. Why did Columbus travel
                west? Why did Marco Polo head east? Because it is that pull,
                that unknown, that prospect of adventure that compels humans to
                seek new frontiers to explore. 
              </p>

                <p>Sending a manned mission to Mars
                is a fantastic adventure. Imagine living on another planet,
                millions of miles from the Earth; looking up into the sky with
                the knowledge that one of the 'stars' is actually the planet you
                were born on. Who can even envision the incredible feeling of
                being the first human in history to step out of the capsule and
                leave your footprint on the surface of Mars? By this we implore
                you to not just think of that feeling for the astronaut, but the
                experience for all those watching back home. Those who observed
                Neil Armstrong land on the Moon all those years ago still
                remember every detail â€“ where they were, who they were with and
                how they felt. The moment the first astronauts land on Mars will
                be our moment to remember.</p>
                
                <p>A second reason is good,
                old-fashioned curiosity. Where did Mars come from? Can it teach
                us about Earth's history? Is there life on Mars? These are just
                three of the hundreds of burning questions for scientists all
                over the world.

              <h2>How long does it take to travel to Mars?</h2>
              <p>
                The trip takes around seven months; a bit longer than astronauts
                currently stay on the International Space Station.
              </p>

              <p>
                The precise duration of each journey depends on when it is
                taken. Because both Mars and Earth's orbits are not perfectly
                circular, the time it takes to travel between them varies from
                six to eight months.
              </p>

              <p>
                When determining the course to Mars, the maximum travel time for
                the astronauts is very important.
